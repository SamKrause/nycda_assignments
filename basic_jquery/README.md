Hunting the Death Star

This is a mini-game where you fly around as an X-wing and chase the Death Star until it is finally caught and destroyed.
Right now the functionality is limited to the Death Star quickly jumping from location to location on each click until finally after 6 or 7 clicks it explodes
and debris flies throughout the screen.

I would like to add the following features:
1. An intro landing page.
	1.A. possibly an option to choose which space craft you can use.
2. Make the Death Star move when the cursor is over it.
	2.A. This might be cooler if it is done on a hover over some div around the death star so it moves before you can actually click it.
3. On click make a flash so it looks like possibly the Death Star went into hyperspace.
4. Add more and different debris on explosion.
5. Add a you win modal with an option to restart.
6. If all of the above work - possibly add multiple levels with different enemy spacecraft that have varying difficutly to destroy.
